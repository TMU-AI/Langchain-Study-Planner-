## The Core Idea

GitHub lets many people work on the same project **without overwriting each other**.

Think of it like Google Docs, but:
- Much more powerful
- Much less forgiving
- Designed by engineers who enjoy precision

## Key Words You Must Understand

### Repository (Repo)
A project folder that lives on the internet.

### Branch
A **copy of the code** where you can safely experiment.

You will work on your own branch.  
You will *not* work on `main`.

### Commit
A saved checkpoint with a message explaining *what* you changed and *why*.

### Push
Uploading your commits to GitHub.

### Pull Request (PR)
A request to merge your work into `main`.

This is how collaboration happens.
This is normal.
This is expected.

## The One Thing Not To Do

🚫 **Do not push to `main`.**

Why?
- Everyone depends on `main`
- One bad push can break the entire project
- Fixing it wastes time and trust
- "Push to main = Cause team pain"

You are not being restricted.
You are being protected.
